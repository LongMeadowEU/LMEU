# Data Processor Audit Report

Out sourcing your data processing to a third party is a clever and efficient way of doing business. However, if you are the company which decides what processing is done to the personal data then you are the Data Controller. As Data Controller you are responsible under the law to ensure that the data is safe - even if it is in the hands of your out-source provider.

An independant data protection audit of processes and systems at you supplier can identify issues before they become real problems for you business. We are not afraid of complexity and the technology does not overwhelm us. We can set your fears to rest and ensure that you have documented evidence which can satisfy the Data Protection Authorities that you are taking Data Protection seriously.

Equally, as a Data Controller being able to present an independant report on your organisations handling of personal data can clinch a contract with a large customer.
