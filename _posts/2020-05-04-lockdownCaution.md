Recent restrictions on movements to and from a formal office environment have impacted some people more than others. Many people, including myself, have already been working partially or almost completely from home or a remote shared office space. This has meant that we have found the transition to the strange new world a little easier than others.

But for many they find that they have lost the familiar surroundings of their office environment and all that comes with that. Now working in the spare bedroom (if you are lucky enough to have one) or on the kitchen table can be more than a little stressful. If you know that you have to handle personal data as part of your job and have to deal with the added stress of the obligations that come with that.

Here are a few hints I hope you find useful:
1. Try to find a space somewhere in your home where you can keep your work stuff together. If you work with personal information in paper form have somewhere to lock it away if possible. At least ensure that none else in your household can accidentally pick it up and put it somewhere you can't find it. I mean, who needs the stress!
1. Keep you personal and work email apart. To avoid confusing yourself use different browsers for each. If your company uses for example G-Suite and you use gmail (which both look very similar!) take a look at using different colour backgrounds and different layouts. At a subconcious level you will stop yourself sending something important to the wrong people.
1. Use OneDrive, SharePoint or Google Drive when sending documents. If you send out an attachment it is very hard to undo it a few minutes later. If you send a link to share you can just change sharing. All these virtual servers are backed up for you and this is another advantage.
1. Hold back on acting on something when you are tired. I like to review important stuff in the morning after I have written it before letting the world see it.
1. Try to keep a structure to your day. I know everyone says this and I know it is really hard to do but it is worth if you stick at it. Most data breaches are made by humans - and most are done by stressed out and tired humans.
1. Take care of yourself - nothing to do with work really - it's just good advice!
