# Integrating Information Systems into your business

Integrating your business into Information Systems that help you get on with your core business can be difficult. A system which works well with your processes and gives you a competitive advantage can be difficult to find.

We specialize in bringing together systems which can bridge the gaps in your process. Integration of systems can reduce human error, improve efficiency and free up people to work on other tasks.

We pride ourselves on our balance of technical knowledge, business analysis and data protection expertise. If you have a small or large system or software project we can help. And if the data is personal data, rest assured that we will advise you on a solution which considers your requirements under GDPR.

# Ensuring your Systems and Processes are GDPR Ready

We're here to help you address the requirements under the Data Protection Legislation. We're not a legal firm, we are in the business of processes and technology and we are offering you a clear and independent advice in getting your business GDPR compliant.

We have expertise in analysing data, large and small to help you unlock opportunities for new business and enhanced services.

We offer services in two areas:

See [Information Systems Projects](../isprojects/) page for more details on how we create IS systems that fit your business.

See [Data Protection Services](../dataprotection/) page for more details on how we can address your data protection needs.
