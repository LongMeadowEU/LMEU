Many of us remember the Wanacry ransom attack. Basically any system infected by the virus simply encrypted all the data on the system hard disk and any hard disks it had access to. It went on to pass the virus along to any system it could.

Those systems then sought a ransom from the owner before the files would be made available again. System owners were presented with 2 options. Restore from a backup or pay the ransom. We have no idea how many paid.

Now this all happened over a year ago. What is interesting is that there still thousands of systems around the world which still carry the virus. While it is no longer a threat to many the fact that it has not been completely irradiated is surprise.

The virus hit the UK's NHS hardest but many businesses admitted that they were affected. The sad truth is that the vulnerability in the Windows Operating System was known about and anyone who was keeping their software systems up-to-date was immune. No need to restore backups or think about paying a ransom.

The value of keeping your systems and software in good health cannot be underestimated. Not only do Operating Systems need attention. Applications, Websites and back end systems rely on software which may have a vulnerability. It's worth doing regular audits to check how they are doing.
