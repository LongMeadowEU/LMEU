One of the central planks of the GDPR platform is the concept of data minimization. You should not keep any data that you don't need.

The concept is easy to grasp. When it comes to personal data you should collect, store and use only what you need for processing. This can simply mean that you may be collecting individuals date of birth, when all you need them to do is to affirm that they are over 18. Do you need to know the sex of your customers? Are you going to treat them any differently because of their age or sex? Probably not. So why gather it? 

But it is probably true that you have collected personal data before, perhaps over several years. And probably about customers who are still active. It's in a database. But what is actually there? Do you need it? Are you actually using it?

It's time to break the covers off that database and take a look inside. It's probably time for a clean-up. Start with what you use the data for and check that every single data element is really needed.

Remember the phrase 'I might need it someday' does not cut it. It's not your information - it belongs to the Data Subject. If you need it someday you simply ask them for it then.

Keeping your data to a minimum has another advantage. In the event of a data breach it can be far less embarrassing if the information is minimal. Think about that.
