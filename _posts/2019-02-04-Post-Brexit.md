The Irish Data Protection Commission has recently released some information on their website pertaining to a potential no-Deal Brexit and personal data.

Web based applications are used by many companies in the EU. Although sold by Irish or EU based companies some of them retain their data in the UK. GDPR by definition ensures that all EU countries can retain personal data and apply GDPR to the protection and access to this data.

In a post Brexit world there are no arraignments at the time of writing to continue this once the UK leaves the Union. It is important that businesses who use applications or retain data that is hosted outside their own four walls know where this data is kept. Just to makes things worse the expression 'Brexit' has crept into our vocabulary making us think it is just Britain will no longer be part of the EU. We must bear in mind that all of the United Kingdom is leaving.
