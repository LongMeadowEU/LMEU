Email seems to be a very easy way to share information with people.

Perhaps a little too easy. It's worth thinking back to a time before email was common in the workplace and how we managed.

If you needed to work with someone or ask them a question you simply made your way to their desk. Weird! You didn't send an email in advance telling them you were coming. You just poked your head around the corner of their office space or workspace and asked them have they got a few moments.

If you needed to bring in more people you walked around to everyone and asked them if they are free at eleven and grabbed a space to meet. If someone was not at their desk when you popped in you just left a note. Things got a little easier when we got a company phone network, you could save some  shoe leather by making a call. Although I still preferred walking around the building when I was setting up meetings. Usually you would have a short chat with them which made working with them all the easier.

Working with people from other countries meant agreed times for phone calls. All agreed in advance - often part of the project plan!

Minutes of meetings were typed up and distributed internally - and would you believe this - people read them! All the technical information was shared using documentation. There were lots of versions until everything was agreed.

In my work there was no question of sending any personal information any other way than in an envelope with the name of both the sender and receiver on it.

These days it's worth slowing down a little. Stop and think before you press send. Is there anything in this message that is personal about you or anyone else? Does the receiver really need it all?  Why are you using â€˜reply all'? Can you just call whoever needs the information?

When it comes to GDPR, email is one of the weakest links. And remember, there was a time when it wasn't there.
