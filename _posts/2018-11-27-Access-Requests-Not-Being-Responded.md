The Data Commissioner has presented her [final report](https://www.dataprotection.ie/docimages/documents/DPC%20Final%20Report%202018EN(1).pdf) to the Oirechtas. The report covers 1 January 2018 to 24 May 2018 at which time GDPR came into effect and the Data Protection Commission took over the role in the new legislation.

While it covers the old regulatory framework the report gives us a good idea of what the trends are in how companies are behaving.

Of the over 1200 complaints she received in this short period, 45% were related to individuals having difficulty getting responses to their requests for information from companies and organisations. Many of these were sorted with her intervention.

However, the introduction of GDPR raised much more awareness amongst the general public about their rights of access to their information. It can be expected that the new commission will report a much higher number of complaints received in this year in their first report.

If your company is not responding to peoples requests for personal information you hold it points to a failure within your company to take Data Privacy seriously. This can only draw the attention of the Commission who is not afraid to follow up with you. It is best to start looking at what personal data you have and start dealing with the responsibilities you have in holding and using it.
