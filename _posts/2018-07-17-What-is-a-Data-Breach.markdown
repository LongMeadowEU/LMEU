The definition of a personal data breach is rather broad. It not only includes the obvious loss of the data through accidental or malicious action but also the processing of the data.

> ‘personal data breach’ means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed;

This means that if the data gets used by you or anyone else in way which it should not have been used then it is a data breach.

So what should you do if you have had a breach or suspect you have had a breach? The GDPR is clear about the first step. In the words of the Irish Data Protection Commisioner:

> From 25th May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduces a requirement for organisations to report personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority, where the breach presents a risk to the affected individuals. Organisations must do this within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach.

If you detect a breach you must consider what potential impact it will have on the Data Subjects. Again in the words of the Irish Data Protection Commisioner:

> Where a breach is likely to result in a high risk to the affected individuals, organisations must also inform those individuals without undue delay.

However, you are not finished here. You must move forward to examine how you should contain this breach and how you might mitigate against further breaches of this type.
