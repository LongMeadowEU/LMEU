# Automating Existing Manual System or Updating an Older System

Are you getting the most out of your employees? Are they repeating manual tasks on a regular basis? Are they bridging a gap between your IT systems or someone else's?

Good people are hard to find and expensive to hire. Is this the best way to utilise your people? Are they getting job satisfaction? Is there a risk that they may leave because do not find their role satisfying?

Information Systems are a key part business now and many companies in many sectors have secured completive advantages by simply using their IT systems to their advantage.

Many processes in some companies are undertaken still with pen and paper and often require a particular person to be there to get the job done. Consider if it were possible to free up these people and automate the process. How could you apply their experience and knowledge better?
