# Moving Existing Systems To The Cloud

Everyone is talking about the cloud. But is it any use to you?

Local servers and systems need to be kept secure and up-to-date. It is your responsibility. But there is overhead in doing this. You can employ your own people to do it or you can have someone else minding the server for you.

But these systems may have a home on the cloud! The cloud offers high availability at low prices. Many companies have cut their costs and increased the reliability of their systems just by moving them to the cloud.

We can look at your current systems and work with you to decide if they are good candidates for moving to the cloud.
