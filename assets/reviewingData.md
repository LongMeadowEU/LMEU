# Reviewing your Data for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

The first steps into the new world of AI and Machine Learning can be overwhelming. You will find yourself with a list of questions which looks something like this:
* Do we have the data we need to move forward?
* How much work will need to be done to prepare the data?
* What security measure do we need to take?
* Will Machine Learning really help give us a business advantage?
Many consultancies will tell you that AI is 'Silver Bullet' that will solve all your problems.
We are the expert in your corner. We can help you look at what you already have and how it could be potentially used before you make a bigger step into the brave new world.

Perhaps you are already engaged with a consultancy or academic research group and you feel the project is not be progressing the way you expected. We can offer independent advice and support which is unbiased and informed.

[Contact us](../contact/) if are interested in hearing more about getting an expert in your corner or email [Michael](mailto:michael@longmeadow.ie) directly.
