Every business has them. Software systems you have had for years. Perhaps you bought them off someone, perhaps you got someone to develop them for you.

They do exactly what they should do - no more , no less. If everything in life was like them.

But there are bad people out there. And they are looking for vulnerability in systems. Any System. Even your loyal friend.

If your system has personal data on it or is used to transfer any personal data then you have a responsibility to ensure that it is well protected. The safest way to do this is to ensure that it has all the correct patches applied and that the software is based on the most up-to-date available. In some cases this may require some small code changes.

But the benefits outweigh the pain. You can be confident that your Loyal System is safe and that the Personal Data of your employees or customers that it processes for you is also safe.
