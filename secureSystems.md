GDPR has put the responsibility on firms to protect Data Subjects Data.

Are you sure that your existing systems are running the most secure data versions? Do you systems include exposures which may undermine them?

Are they as secure as they need to be? Do they support Subject Access Requests? Is data being removed within the retention period? Is the right to be forgotten being addressed?

Many systems which have been loyal servants for many years are now in need of some loving attention. Just to keep them safe. Just to keep them GDPR compliant.
